## September 2026 audit changes

Production ingestion POST endpoints require an authenticated staff user. Local and test settings retain anonymous ingestion. `AthleteStatsIngestionService` requires an explicit season if the upstream response has no season year; it preserves the returned Common v3 categories. See [the audit report](../docs/audit-2026-09-30.md) for evidence and limitations.
